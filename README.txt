Hello!

To use this program it needs to be provided with 3 files:

(IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING, REPLACE "Lang" WITH THE NAME OF YOUR LANGUAGE"
AND PLACE THEM ALL IN A FOLDER NAMED "Lang". SEE THE KOAE EXAMPLE)

1. "Lang.txt"
This is the file where you will put all of the words in your language 
that you want the city generator to use to make names of cities, lakes, forests,
whatever. Each word needs to be on a separate line.


2. "Lang_eng.txt"
This should be EXACTLY the same length as "Lang.txt" but it is the direct English
translations (in one or two words) for each item in 'Lang.txt". The way the program
reads this is equating each line. e.g. if line 4 in "Lang.txt" is "strome" (no quotes)
and line 4 in "Lang_eng.txt" is "mountain". Then the translation of "strome" is
"mountain".


3. "Lang_settings.txt"
This is the most complicated file.
Each line in this file is a list of random things. The line it is on determines 
which things it is. Each line can contain an infinite number of entries though.
There is a guide to this file provided named "Lang_settings_guide.txt" which is never
read by the program and exists only to ease customization.
!!ALL LANDORMS MUST BE IN ENGLISH!!
